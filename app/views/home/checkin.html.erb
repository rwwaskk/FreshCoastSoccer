	<h3>Check In</h3>
</div>
<p>There are <strong>over 100 teams</strong> competing  in each of these events with all the action taking place on the Main Beach! To  help get us all through registration, we encourage all teams to attend early  registration Friday evening before each event and to carpool as much as  possible. A free beach soccer clinic is offered for players and your team from  7-8pm. Players learn the game while parents can sign in, purchase sand socks, and t-shirts. Â Friday check-in is important because we will  need to verify all paperwork (roster, waivers), as well as ID all players  (photo ids required) or get most done to quicken process for players who arrive  the next day. We can hold their passes and have them collect them at  verification on Saturday or they can show us the pass/id on Saturday. In other  words, <strong>ALL players MUST show up IN PERSON to have their identity  verified and to receive their wristband</strong>. We will put the wristband on  each player once we have ID'd them.</p>
<p>As an alternative, you may send ONE team representative to register the team on Friday to get the paperwork in  order. This representative should bring ALL paperwork for EVERY player (waivers and copies of ids/photos), in addition to the FINAL team roster. If players are  unable to be there Friday, they may check-in on Saturday (must be at least 1 hour prior to the team&rsquo;s first scheduled game) to receive their wristbands.  Please keep in mind Saturday will already be extremely hectic...and with over 120 teams, the check-in lines may be very long!</p>
<p>Any teams and players who do <strong>not</strong> register and check-in on Friday must do so on Saturday, <strong>no later than 1 hour prior to the team's first game</strong>.</p>
<p>The following forms are required from each player on the roster:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Age verification and identification for youth by US, NorCal or CYSA player pass (prefer government issued photo id, but for those younger players w/o a CDL or passport a birth certificate, school card or other photo will suffice),</li>
  <li>ORIGINAL signed Waiver and Release of Liability forms must be submitted at check-in, NO LATER than 2 hours prior to the teams first game (executed by player and parent if player is under 18 years old),</li>
  <li>Photo (if not included on a form of id listed above). If the player does not have a form of id with a picture, they need to provide a current CLEAR photo of the player's face for identification. The photo will be kept as part of our records. A player card may be used as a photo id, but a birth certificate or second form of identification will still be required (birth certificate, government/school id).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please drive safely, and GO THE  SPEED LIMIT. There are several CHP along Highway 17 and the road has several  twists and turns. Also, we are very conscious of our impact on the traffic so  we strongly encourage you to form carpools to attend this event and walk to the  beach and drop off equipment at the drop zones. Please have a shuttle for  players and equipment to get to the beach in order to reduce traffic and  parking issues. We will have a location to drop players off in front of  Entrance 3. If you can walk from your hotel, please do so. Thanks!</p>
